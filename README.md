# Marine Seismic Time-Series Analysis with LightningChart Python

## Introduction

Marine seismic research is a crucial aspect of geophysical exploration that involves studying subsurface geological formations beneath the ocean floor. These studies primarily rely on marine seismic surveys which utilize sound waves to create detailed images of the seabed and the underlying geological structures. The data collected from these surveys are vital for various applications including oil and gas exploration, environmental studies, and geological research [1][2][3].

## LightningChart Python

### Overview of LightningChart Python

LightningChart is a high-performance charting library designed for creating advanced data visualizations in Python. It offers a wide range of features and chart types, making it ideal for creating complex dashboards and data analysis tools. Key features include high rendering performance, a variety of chart types (e.g., line charts, heatmaps, bar charts), and extensive customization options [4].

### Features and Chart Types to be Used in the Project

In this project, we utilize LightningChart to create various visualizations for analyzing marine seismic data. The key chart types used include line charts, bar charts, and real-time charts. These visualizations help in understanding the distribution, relationships, and significance of different seismic events:

- **Line Charts**: Used to visualize seismic trace data over time, helping to identify significant seismic events and their characteristics.
- **Bar Charts**: Employed to display the distribution of seismic trace values, allowing for a clear understanding of the frequency of different amplitude ranges.
- **Real-Time Charts**: Implemented to monitor seismic data in real-time, providing immediate insights into ongoing seismic activity.

### Performance Characteristics

LightningChart excels in rendering large datasets quickly and efficiently. This is particularly important for real-time data visualization and for handling the extensive data typically involved in marine seismic time-series analysis. The library's performance characteristics ensure smooth, responsive visualizations, even with datasets containing millions of rows and thousands of traces.

## Setting Up Python Environment

### Installing Python and Necessary Libraries

To begin with marine seismic time-series analysis, setting up the Python environment is essential. The following steps outline the process. Additionally, you'll need to install the necessary libraries, including NumPy, Pandas, LightningChart, and ObsPy.

### Overview of Libraries Used

- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **ObsPy**: For reading and processing seismic data in SEG-Y format.
- **LightningChart**: For creating high-performance data visualizations.

### Setting Up Your Development Environment

1. Set up your development environment by creating a virtual environment and installing the necessary libraries. This ensures that your project dependencies are isolated and manageable.
2. Using Visual Studio Code (VSCode): Visual Studio Code (VSCode) is a popular code editor that offers a rich set of features to enhance your development workflow.

## Loading and Processing Data

### How to Load the Data Files

Loading and processing seismic data involves several steps. The provided dataset is a 2D multichannel seismic dataset acquired using airgun and streamer systems, contributed by the Pacific Coastal and Marine Science Center. The dataset, recorded between November 3, 1989, and November 26, 1989, comprises 31 tracklines covering a distance of 7398 km around Hawaii. Here in this article, the dataset related to the 16th trackline is used [5].

### Extracting and Saving Data

The following script reads the SEG-Y file, extracts relevant trace headers and trace values, and saves them into a CSV file:

```python
import obspy
import pandas as pd

segy_file = 'D:/path/to/your/file.sgy'
st = obspy.read(segy_file, format='SEGY')

valid_keys = [
    'trace_sequence_number_within_line', 
    'trace_sequence_number_within_segy_file',
    'original_field_record_number',
    'trace_number_within_the_original_field_record',
    'energy_source_point_number',
    'source_coordinate_x',
    'source_coordinate_y',
    'sample_interval_in_ms_for_this_trace',
    'year_data_recorded'
]

data = []
for tr in st:
    trace_header = tr.stats.segy.trace_header
    trace_data = tr.data
    for i, value in enumerate(trace_data):
        row = {key: trace_header[key] for key in valid_keys if key in trace_header}
        row['trace_value'] = value
        row['sample_number'] = i
        data.append(row)

df = pd.DataFrame(data)
df.to_csv('D:/path/to/output.csv', index=False)
```

## Visualizing Data with LightningChart
